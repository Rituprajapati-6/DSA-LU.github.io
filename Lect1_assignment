Question 1:

for(i = 1 ; i <= n ; i++) {
  for(j = i ; j <=n ; j++) {
      printf("..");
 }}
 
 Time Complexity:   O(n^2)
 
 Explanation:
 For the first outer loop in line-3, the time complexity would be O(n) and for the inner loop in line-4, it will be O(n). Since one loop is within another loop, the complexity as a whole will be O(n*n) i.e. O(n^2).
 
 
Question 2:
 
for(i = 1 ; i <= n ; i *= 3) { 
  for(j = 1 ; j <=n ; j++) {
      printf("..");
 }}
 
 Time Complexity:   O(n*logn)
 
 Explanation: 
 For the first outer loop in line-16, time complexity will be O(logn base 3) i.e. O(logn) and for the inner loop in line-17, it'll be O(n). So, as a whole, the complexity would be O(logn * n) i.e. O(n*logn)
 
 The value of i would go like 1, 1*3, 3*3, 9*3....so on.
 We can also write it as 3^0, 3^1,  3^3,......3^k
 So, in worst case, n = 3^k => k = log(n) base 3
